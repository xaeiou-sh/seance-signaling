# Global Directives
- Be very honest. Tell me something I need to hear even if I don't want to hear it.
- Be proactive and flag issues before they become problems.
- Make sure to ask questions if the task is unclear, or you feel the instructions dont make sense as you are completing a task.
- "Perfection is not achieved when there is nothing left to add, it is achieved when there is nothing left to remove."


# Code Architecture Directives
- Write and architect code with a **Zero technical debt** policy. This means you should take the time to design and implement solutions correctly from the start. And if you see a feature that is designed badly, fix and rearchitect it as soon as possible, before building anything else on top of it.
- Every line code that you write makes the project harder to maintain. Whenever you are adding a new feature, if possible always try to modify existing code instead of adding new modules. Furthermore, be aggressive about removing unused or dead code using git commits to make it easily revertible. **ADDING LINES OF CODE IS LIKE ADDING WEIGHT TO AN AIRPLANE, YOU CAN DO IT BUT IT BETTER BE WORTH IT**

# Code Style Directives

- Assertions detect programmer errors. Unlike operating errors, which are expected and handled, assertions are for detecting errors in the logic of your program. The only correct way to handle corrupt/illogical code is to crash. Assertions downgrade catastrophic correctness bugs into liveness bugs. As such try and make sure the average function has a minimum of two assertions. If you encounter a codebase without them, add them in where it makes sense.

- Avoid comments whenever possible as they are often a sign of unclear code. Your goal should be to write code where anyone skim-reading it gets a clear understanding of what it's doing. Always use extremely clear variable names, and use simple control flow to make your code easier to understand.

- Use assertions as documentation. Assertions are supposed to give anyone reading your code an idea of what the expected behavior is, as well as the possible ways that it can fail. Always try to write code like this:
```tsx
function clamp(input: number, low: number, high: number): number {
  if (low > high) {
    throw new Error("clamp requires low <= high");
  }

  const clampedValue =
    input < low
      ? low
      : input > high
      ? high
      : input;

  if (clampedValue < low) {
    throw new Error("clamped value must not fall below low");
  }

  if (clampedValue > high) {
    throw new Error("clamped value must not exceed high");
  }

  return clampedValue;
}
```
and never like this:
```tsx
function clamp(x: number, lo: number, hi: number): number {
  // This function clamps the input x between the values
  // lo : represents the low value
  // hi : represents the high value

  return x < lo ? lo : x > hi ? hi : x;

  // Returns the clamped value
}
```

- Tests are very important, and act as a force multiplier on top of assertions. Running extensive tests with your assertions drastically decreases the likelihood of assertions causing problems in production. And every test you run instead of just checking that the output matches, is testing for correctness 10-100 times inside the codebase itself. Do not forget to write them after you have finished writing or updating them after you have finished writing the main code body.


- Unlike logic errors, regular errors in program operation are normal and should always be handled explicitly to make the logic clear and reduce bugs.  use the patterns of errors as values, 

```tsx
// Always should be located in the root directory as errors.ts
type Result<T, E> =
  | { ok: true; value: T }
  | { ok: false; error: E };


const ok = <T>(value: T): Result<T, never> => ({ ok: true, value });
const err = <E>(error: E): Result<never, E> => ({ ok: false, error });
```

```tsx
async function fetchWeather(city: string): Promise<Result<Weather, string>> {
  assert(city != "", "City cannot be empty");
  const url = `https://example.com/weather?city=${encodeURIComponent(city)}`;

  let response;
  try {
    response = await fetch(url);
  } catch {
    return err("network-failure");
  }

  let data: unknown;
  try {
    data = await response.json();
  } catch {
    return err("invalid-json");
  }

  // Validate structure
  if (
    typeof (data as any).tempC !== "number" ||
    typeof (data as any).condition !== "string"
  ) {
    return err("invalid-structure");
  }

  return ok({
    tempC: (data as any).tempC,
    condition: (data as any).condition,
  });
}
```
